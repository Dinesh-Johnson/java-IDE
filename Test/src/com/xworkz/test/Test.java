//3.initialize array : datatype[] variableName={array values}; ex: int[] a={1,5,8,9};
//4.length of an Array = VariableName.length. ex: a.length=4
//5.first its initialize the value and move on to condition segment then condition is true its execute
//the body of the program and its iterate over the creatine and decrement

//6.class - it is a blueprint of the program
//object - it is the behaviour of the program

//7.No we can't declare two methods with same signature but inter changing thr access and non access Specifier

//8.types of methods
//      1.Static
//      2.Non-Static
//      3.Local
//      4.Parametrised
//      declare a method: ClassName.methodName(){ body of the programme}

//9.we have to use lesser value or use the condition(ForLoopdatatypeName<arrayName.length)
// the value should be less than the length of an array

//

// 10.int[] array ={1,8,5,98};
//    copy : int copyArray[] = array;

//14.= assignment operator
//     == comparison

//15.WORA- Write Ones Run Anywhere
        // we can run the java programs anywhere in any platform. because every platform there is different
        // JVM(jav virtual MMachine) for different platform to tun it
